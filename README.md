# Autonomous Vehicle

This repo stores my exploration of vehicle dynamics, control, and planning.
It is for educational purposes.

## Installation

At this time, the repo codebase uses Python and Jupyter notebook for coding visualization.
To run its contents, perform the following steps:

0. Install Python 3 and the virtualenv package (if you do not already have them)
1. Clone this repo
2. Within the repo root, run `virtualenv . -p python3`
3. `source bin/activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

You should now have everything you need to run this code.
